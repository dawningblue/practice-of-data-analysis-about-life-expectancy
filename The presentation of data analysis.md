The data comes from the China Health and Family Planning Statistical Digest (2018) produced by the National Health Commission

# section 1 : The distribution of national average life expectancy over  time

As we can see from the picture , the life expectancy has increased from 68 to 74 during the past 30 years , for 3 years every decade.The most likely reason for this may be the rappid development of the economic. 
Let us propose a  hypothesis that——the life expectancy is positively correlated with economic development level . And this hypothesis will be the further validated later in this report.



# section 2 : The distribution of life expectancy over gender

In these pictures, we can see that ,at any time(maybe any where)，women live longer than men about 3 to 4 years. This Statistical result is consistent with our daily observations.


# section 3: The distribution of life expectancy over space

In the following pictures , we will observe the data change from the geographical  perspective.We use the depth of color to indicate the life expectancy.We can  discover three noteable things after analyzing this picutres

1. We can divide the whole China into three parts by the depth of color——the eastern region，the central region and the western region. The more it close to the east side the depth of it's color will be. This kind of color depth distribution  is  consistent with the distribution of economic development level. This evidence reveals that the distribution of life expectancy over area is positively correlated with economic development level when fixing the time variable.So combing the hypothesis mentioned earlier , We can safely draw such a conclusion that the distribution of life expectancy is positively correlated with economic development level.

2. Although the expectancy among the areas is increasing(take sichuan as example), the fact that the magnitude relation between areas is still stable. This shows that the development speed of the central and western regions is not as fast as that of the eastern regions. As usually, underdeveloped regions may achieve a relatively higher economic growth rate, whereas developed regions may slow down, or grow at a relatively lower pace.So it is weird.A serious problems revealed by this phenomenon is that despite of receiving plenty of policy supports from governmnet ,the gap between the developed areas and the middle west is becoming more an more large.

3. Another small but noteworthy phenomenon is that the growth rate of life expectancy in developed regions is almost or even smaller than the increase in life expectancy in underdeveloped regions.There may be two reasons:
  * The growth of everything is limited. The prolongation of Life is no exception.
  * The contribution of medical treatment in prolonging life is become more and more small .The improvement of medical level can significantly increase the life expectancy of underdeveloped areas, but the effect will be less and less obvious with the increase of life expectancy. The comfortable living environment,the harmonious society and a healthy lifestyle may make our life long and better. But we may not be able to achieve these goals simply by developing the economy.
